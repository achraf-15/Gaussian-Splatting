# Image-GS (CUDA + PyTorch Implementation)

This repository contains my implementation of **[Image-GS: Content-Adaptive Image Representation via 2D Gaussians](https://doi.org/10.1145/3721238.3730596)** (Zhang et al., SIGGRAPH 2025).

## Overview
- Implemented a **differentiable renderer** in **CUDA** with **tileâ€“Gaussian correspondence** for efficient image reconstruction.  
- Integrated with **PyTorch** for optimization and the rest of the training pipeline.  

## Reference
If you use this code, please cite the original paper.
